## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:

While creating this app, I encountered difficulties that required me to review some JavaScript concepts and write corresponding code based on the requirements. I used resources from CodePath and searched online for relevant information. For example, understanding the difference between innerHTML and innerText, or when implementing the optional feature of a search bar, I discovered that if you input a blank space, it still returns search results. Therefore, it was necessary to restrict the input keywords to get accurate results.
